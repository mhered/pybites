# My PyBites Code Archive

This repo contains all the code submitted by me on the PyBites platform [codechalleng.es/](https://codechalleng.es/) as part of my [#100DaysOfCode](https://codechalleng.es/100days/mhered8b899449424048c5/8180) challenge between October and December 2022.
Each folder contains the last 5 commits per Bite and any notes submitted. The filename shows if the submission passed or failed on the platform.

## To do

- [ ] scrape my [public profile page](https://codechalleng.es/profiles/mhered8b899449424048c5) to get a table of the bites, dates, number of submissions, points etc
- [ ] make a table with links to the bites on the platform and the code on my repo
- [ ] make graphs with the progress
